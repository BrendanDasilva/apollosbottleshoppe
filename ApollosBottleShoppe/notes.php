    <h2>Assignment Notes</h2>

    <p>As I write this section at the completion of the project, I've spent approximately 22 hours bringing this site to its current state. I believe this has been the most engaging project we've had to do so far. The complexity and variety of tasks offered more than the isolated functions we dealt with in previous semesters. Although at times frustrating, the challenges made the experience extremely rewarding and enjoyable.</p>

    <p>Initially, I had encountered difficulties with the cookie implementation. It functioned well locally, but issues arose when I uploaded it to the GBLearn servers. I was relieved when that requirement was dropped! Given the volume and complexity of the work involved, this project felt substantial for a 5% assignment. It could easily have been a larger-scale project, given its scope. Despite wishing it accounted for a larger portion of the grade, I appreciate having started early, allowing me to navigate through the challenges and complete it on time.</p>
    
    <p>Have a look around and I hope you enjoy what I was able to put together!</p>
